          <h2>A Special Beginning ❤️✨</h2>

       <p>
        Four years ago, I met someone very special—you. 💖 Back then, we were just two strangers in the same place, not knowing what life had planned for us. I still remember the first time I saw you—your bright smile, your beautiful eyes, and the way you walked with confidence. ✨ I didn’t know that moment would change my life forever. As days passed, I started noticing you more, and my heart felt different. 💕 I was not sure if it was love, but I knew you were special. Slowly, my heart started racing every time I saw you. I wanted to know you, talk to you, and be near you. Little did I know, you would become the most important part of my life. 🥰 You made even the simplest moments feel magical. Every time I saw you, my day felt brighter. Life felt different after you came into it. 🌷

            At first, I didn’t understand what I felt for you. But every time I saw you, my heart beat faster. 💓 I waited to see you, even if it was just for a second. Your voice, your laughter, and the way you talked made my day brighter. 🌸 I wanted to talk to you, but I was scared. What if you didn’t feel the same way? What if you didn’t even notice me? But still, I couldn’t stop thinking about you. I started finding reasons to be near you, hoping you would see me too. I didn’t know when it happened, but my simple crush had turned into something more. 💖 My heart was no longer in my control. I started dreaming about you, thinking about you all the time. Every little thing you did made me fall for you even more. You became the reason for my happiness. 🌷

            The first time I saw you, I felt something special. 💕 But you were my senior, so I didn’t tell anyone. Every day, I looked at you from far, hoping you would notice me. 😌 I loved your smile, the way you talked, and everything about you. But I thought you would never see me like that. Time passed, and we became friends. 🌸 From just friends, we became close friends. We talked more, shared our thoughts, and spent time together. Then one day, something magical happened—you told me your feelings first! ❤️ I couldn’t believe it. That moment, my heart knew we were meant to be. Since that day, we have been together, and I have loved you more every single day. 💖

            உன் கண்கள் பார்த்த நாள், என் இதயம் விழுந்தது,
உன் சிரிப்பு கேட்ட நாள், என் ஆனந்தம் மலர்ந்தது.
நாம் சேர்ந்த இரண்டு ஆண்டுகள், காதல் கனிந்த நாட்கள்,
உன்னை நினைத்த கணமே, என் உலகம் முழுவதும் நீயாகிறாய்.
என்றும் உன் காதலனாக, உன் அன்பில் வாழ்ந்திடுவேன். 💞
